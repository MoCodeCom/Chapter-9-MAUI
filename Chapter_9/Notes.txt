Notes:
- there are more than one way to implements INotifyChanges in MVVM pattren.
- ONE: by us this Interface in Model data class for all data structure.
- TWO: throw us this Interface just with the Editable data in View data (mvVm)
- In the way TWO we will use data of three possible options:
  delete and add OR edit
  so, treated data that delete and add as nonTrivial pattren (without INotfyChange)
   whereas, delete data will use Trivial mode (INotifyChange) in View section to be much more practical for
   operation that drived form ModelView part in MVVM.
